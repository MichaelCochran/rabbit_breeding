# Overview

Animal Breeding is a tool designed to help farmers and breeders track and optimize the productivity of their livestock. Initially focused on rabbits, the software has expanded to support goats, cows, pigs, and rabbits, with the potential to include additional species based on user interest.  

# Relational Database

As this project is intended to be used with multiple species on the farm, there will be a separate database for each species. Within the database there will be information about the mating pair along with calculations for gestation and other vital information that will be unique to each species. For example rabbits have a date where you palpatae the female to see if she is pregnant at about 2 weeks after breeding. However, with cows, you must wait until 5 weeks to palpatate the female to see if she is pregnant. 

# Future Work

- Expand to additional livestock based on user feedback and interest.  
- Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for mobile and desktop.  
- Enhance analytics and reporting features.

## Scope and Limitations  
- **Current Scope**: CLI-based tracking for goats, cows, pigs, and rabbits.  
- **Limitations**: No advanced tracking features (e.g., lactation data) or poultry support at this time.  

Feedback and suggestions are welcome to help shape the future of the tool!
