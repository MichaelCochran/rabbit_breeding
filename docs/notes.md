# Notes for future work:

## **Rabbits:**
- **Palpation:** Experienced breeders can detect fetuses by gentle abdominal palpation around 12 to 14 days post-mating.
- **Ultrasound:** Can confirm pregnancy as early as 7 days post-mating, though more commonly performed around 10 days.
- **Nesting Box Placement:** Place a nesting box in the doe's enclosure around day 28 to 29 to allow her to prepare for kindling (giving birth).
- **Due Date:** Expect delivery around day 31.

## **Goats:**
- **Ultrasound:** Transabdominal ultrasound is effective from 30 days post-breeding, with optimal accuracy after 45 days.
- **Blood Tests:** Pregnancy-associated glycoproteins (PAGs) can be detected in blood samples as early as 28 days post-breeding.
- **Due Date:** 145 to 155 days, averaging around 150 days.

## **Sheep:**
- **Ultrasound:** Transabdominal ultrasound is commonly performed around 45 to 90 days post-breeding for pregnancy confirmation and fetal counting.
- **Blood Tests:** PAGs can be detected in blood samples from 35 days post-breeding. 
- **Due Date:** Approximately 144 to 151 days.

## **Cows:**
- **Rectal Palpation:** Traditionally performed by veterinarians from about 35 days post-breeding.
- **Ultrasound:** Transrectal ultrasound can detect pregnancy as early as 28 days post-breeding.
- **Blood Tests:** PAGs can be detected in blood samples from 28 days post-breeding.
- **Due Date:** Approximately 279 to 290 days, depending on the breed.

## **Pigs:**
- **Ultrasound:** Real-time ultrasound can confirm pregnancy around 21 to 25 days post-mating.
- **Doppler Ultrasound:** Detects fetal heartbeats and can be used from 26 days post-mating.
- **Hormonal Assays:** Estrone sulfate levels can be measured in plasma, urine, or feces between 4 to 6 weeks post-mating.
- **Due Date:** Approximately 114 days (3 months, 3 weeks, and 3 days).
