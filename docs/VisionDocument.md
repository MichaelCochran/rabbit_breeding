# Vision Document


## 1. Introduction
**Animal Breeding** is a software tool designed to help farmers monitor and optimize the productivity of their livestock. Originally developed to address inefficiencies in rabbit breeding, the tool has expanded to include goats, cows, pigs, and rabbits, with plans to potentially support additional livestock species based on user interest. The primary objective is to track and analyze breeding outcomes, enabling farmers to make informed decisions about breeding strategies and resource allocation.


## 2. Product / Solution Overview
This software is targeted at farmers and breeders who want to efficiently track and improve the productivity of their livestock. By reducing time and resources spent on unsuccessful pairings, the software aims to:
- Identify productive and unproductive pairings.
- Provide clear, organized records to support decision-making.
- Increase the overall efficiency of livestock breeding operations.

Currently, the software operates as a command-line interface (CLI) tool. Future plans include developing a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use, likely in the form of a mobile app. Cross-platform compatibility will be prioritized to ensure accessibility on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## 3. Business Needs / Requirements
The software currently tracks the following data for goats, cows, pigs, and rabbits:
- Breeding pair details.
- Breeding dates.
- Gestation-related dates and milestones.

Future updates may include:
- Additional species if there is enough interest from users.
- Advanced analytics to identify trends and optimize productivity for each supported species.

A study will be conducted to gather user feedback and determine the features needed to expand and refine the software's capabilities.

## 4. Major Features
1. **Breeding Record Management**: Maintain detailed records of breeding pairs, dates, and outcomes for goats, cows, pigs, and rabbits.
2. **Gestation Tracking**: Automatically calculate species-specific dates, such as palpation checks, nesting preparation, and birthing/delivery dates.
3. **Performance Analysis**: Identify unproductive pairings and animals to streamline breeding operations.
4. **Data Accessibility**: Allow users to input and view data using a CLI, with planned upgrades to a mobile-friendly GUI and cross-platform accessibility.
5. **Species-Specific Tracking**: Tailor tracking and calculations to the unique reproductive needs of goats, cows, pigs, and rabbits.

## 5. Scope and Limitations
### **Scope**
- The current scope of the software is limited to tracking breeding data for goats, cows, pigs, and rabbits. Future expansions to include additional livestock will depend on user interest and demand.
- Planned upgrades include:
  - A graphical user interface for improved usability.
  - A mobile app to facilitate real-time data input in the field.
  - Cross-platform accessibility for desktop and mobile devices.
  - Enhanced reporting and analytics to provide deeper insights into productivity and breeding success.

### **Limitations**
- The current version is CLI-based, which may lack the visual clarity and ease of use provided by a GUI.
- Advanced tracking features, such as lactation data or weight gain monitoring, are not yet included but may be added in future updates based on user feedback.
- The initial release focuses on goats, sheep, cows, pigs, and rabbits, with plans to include other animals if there is significant interest.
